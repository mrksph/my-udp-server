# MyServer 

MyServer is a fast open source UDP game server.

## Introduction

This is my first attempt at making a game server from scratch. 
This server uses the UDP protocol to communicate with clients.

## Features

The server is heavily based on Glowstone, a Minecraft a highly
customizable and open source Minecraft server.

The idea is to allow multiple players to connect to a room and 
then start a game session.
